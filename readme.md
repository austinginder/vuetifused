# [Vuetifused](https://vuetifused.com) - A Vuetify infused WordPress admin experience.

Say Goodbye `wp-admin` and hello to Vuetifused.


A minimalist solution for staying out of WordPressâ€™ bloated wp-admin. Using Vuetifused will replace the default wp-admin with a Vuetify backend. Will allow basic management features like managing themes and plugins. Will most certainly not be compatible with any plugin backends.
