A Vuetify infused WordPress admin experience.

== Description ==

[Vuetifused](https://vuetifused.com) is a minimalist solution for staying out of WordPressâ€™ bloated wp-admin. Using Vuetifused will replace the default wp-admin with a Vuetify backend. Will allow basic management features like managing themes and plugins. Will most certainly not be compatible with any plugin backends. Say Goodbye `wp-admin` and hello to Vuetifused.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/vuetifused/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Each user may enter Vuetifused from the admin bar by selecting 'Enable Vuetifused'.

== Changelog ==
= 1.0.0: Dec 26 2020
* New: Initial release of Vuetifused. Includes basic content, themes and plugins management for site administrators. Vuetifused can be toggled on/off per user account.
