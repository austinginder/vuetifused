A Vuetify infused WordPress admin experience.

== Description ==

[Vuetifused](https://vuetifused.com) is a minimalist solution for staying out of WordPressâ€™ bloated wp-admin. Using Vuetifused will replace the default wp-admin with a Vuetify backend. Will allow basic management features like managing themes and plugins. Will most certainly not be compatible with any plugin backends. Say Goodbye `wp-admin` and hello to Vuetifused.

== Installation ==

1. Download latest release [zip from Github](https://github.com/austinginder/vuetifused/releases).
2. On WordPress backend select "Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload Plugin" and drag and drop the downloaded zip onto "Choose File" then "Install Now".
3. Select "Enable Vuetifused" from the admin bar. This is enabled per user and can be exited at anytime by selecting exit icon in the top right.

== Changelog ==
= 1.0.0: Dec 26 2020
* New: Initial release of Vuetifused. Includes basic content, themes and plugins management for site administrators. Vuetifused can be toggled on/off per user account.
